This dilutes the goal (Fitts\u2019s Law; Goal-Gradient). Solution: Replace with two high-contrast CTAs: 'Start Free Trial' (primary, filled button) and 'Book a Demo' (secondary, outline). Keep them visible via a sticky footer/header CTA on scroll. Relates to expert note on unclear primary action."", ""tags"": ""Critical""}, {""title"": ""Clarify value proposition with scannable subheads"", ""recommendation"": ""Problem: The headline 'Concept to Compliance, Powered by AI' is aspirational but vague; the tiny subtext under it is hard to read on the textured background, reducing comprehension (Jakob\u2019s Law; Nielsen\u2019s Heuristic\u2014Match between system and real world). Solution: Add a concise benefit subhead: 'Automated crypto compliance and risk monitoring for institutions.' Move supportive copy to a darker overlay for contrast and larger font size (WCAG legibility).

Solution: Add short, parallel one-line benefits on each card and a clear action per card ('Learn more', 'Try now', 'Request demo'). Use a featured badge to highlight the recommended starter (e.g., 'Risk Analytics\u2014Best place to start') to guide non-expert users. A/B test icon + title as the tap target, not just the tiny link.

Solution: Add a clear play button with contrasting circle and label '2-min overview'. Provide captions and a short bullet summary below with a CTA 'See it in action\u2014Book a demo'.
